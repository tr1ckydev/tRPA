RPA stands for Remote Property Access.

Access server side properties and functions on client side just as if they were one.

- Framework agnostic API.
- Full static typesafety with autocompletion on client.
- No dependencies and client library weights <1kb (minified).
- Get up and running with your existing project in minutes.

## Why tRPA?

RPC only allows you to execute procedures i.e. functions. What about static properties? With tRPA you can do both, access server side properties as well as execute remote functions from client side just as if you would from server side.

The API mainly revolves around two main functions: `exportToClient` and `importFromServer`. Pretty self-explanatory.
